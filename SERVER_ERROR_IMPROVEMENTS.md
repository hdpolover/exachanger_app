# Server Error Handling Improvements

## Problem
Your Flutter app was experiencing 500 Internal Server Error from the metadata API endpoint (`/api/mobile/v1/metadata?page=onboarding-page&type=1`). While the retry mechanism was working (3 attempts), the user experience was poor with generic error messages and the app potentially crashing or showing empty content.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling (`error_handlers.dart`)
- **Better Server Error Messages**: Added specific handling for 500, 502, 503, and 504 errors with user-friendly messages
- **Contextual Messages**: Different messages based on error type:
  - 500: "The server is currently experiencing issues. Please try again later."
  - 502/504: "Service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a few minutes."

### 2. Improved Retry Strategy (`retry_interceptor.dart`)
- **Exponential Backoff**: Changed from linear to exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s instead of 1s, 2s, 3s)
- **Better Logging**: Added timing information for retry attempts

### 3. Graceful Degradation (`welcome_controller.dart`)
- **Fallback Content**: When metadata fails to load, app now shows default welcome content instead of crashing
- **Smart Error Handling**: Metadata failures are treated as non-critical - app continues to function
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents repeated failed API calls when service is consistently down

### 4. Circuit Breaker Pattern (`circuit_breaker.dart`)
- **Prevents API Spam**: After 3 consecutive failures, stops making metadata API calls for 2 minutes
- **Service-Specific**: Different thresholds for different services (metadata is more lenient)
- **Automatic Recovery**: Gradually tries to restore service availability

### 5. User-Friendly Error Messaging (`error_message_utils.dart`)
- **Context-Aware Messages**: Different error messages based on which API endpoint failed
- **Criticality Assessment**: Determines if an error should block user flow or just show a message
- **Endpoint-Specific Handling**: Special handling for metadata, auth, transaction, and promo services

### 6. Enhanced Base Controller (`base_controller.dart`)
- **Better API Error Handling**: Improved handling of 4xx and 5xx errors with appropriate user feedback
- **Smart Snackbars**: Shows different colored and styled snackbars based on error severity
- **Non-Blocking Errors**: Non-critical errors don't disrupt user flow

### 7. State Management Widgets (`state_widgets.dart`)
- **Loading States**: Better loading indicators with optional retry buttons
- **Error States**: Consistent error display across the app
- **Empty States**: Proper handling of empty data scenarios

## Key Benefits

### For Users:
1. **No More Crashes**: App continues to work even when metadata API fails
2. **Clear Communication**: Users see helpful error messages instead of technical gibberish
3. **Seamless Experience**: Default content is shown when server data isn't available
4. **Faster Recovery**: Exponential backoff reduces wait times for subsequent retries

### For Developers:
1. **Better Debugging**: More detailed logging with context and user-friendly messages
2. **Reduced Support Load**: Users experience fewer issues and get better error information
3. **Service Health Monitoring**: Circuit breaker pattern helps identify persistent service issues
4. **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized error handling across all API calls

## Testing the Improvements

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Server Down**: Metadata API returns 500 - App should show default welcome content
2. **Network Issues**: No internet - App should show network error message
3. **Intermittent Failures**: Some requests fail - Circuit breaker should engage after 3 failures
4. **Service Recovery**: After circuit breaker opens, it should gradually try to restore service

### Expected Behavior:
- Users see the welcome screen with default content instead of errors
- Error messages are helpful and non-technical
- App doesn't spam the server with repeated failed requests
- User flow continues uninterrupted for non-critical API failures

## Configuration

The circuit breaker can be tuned for different services:
- **Metadata Service**: 3 failures trigger 2-minute cooldown (more lenient)
- **Other Services**: 5 failures trigger 5-minute cooldown
- **Retry Timeout**: 30 seconds before attempting half-open state

These values can be adjusted based on your server infrastructure and user requirements.

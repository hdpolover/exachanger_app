# Server Error Recovery Dependency Fix

## Problem
When the app encounters a server error (HTTP 5xx), the `CriticalErrorService` shows a server error page using `Get.offAllNamed('/server-error')`. This clears the navigation stack and potentially destroys dependency injection containers. When the user returns to the splash screen after connection is restored, the `AuthRemoteDataSource` and other critical dependencies are missing, causing the error:

```
"AuthRemoteDataSource" not found. You need to call "Get.put(AuthRemoteDataSource())" or "Get.lazyPut(()=>AuthRemoteDataSource())"
```

## Additional Issue - Automatic Navigation
The original server error page had an automatic navigation problem where it would dismiss itself and return to the splash screen without user interaction. This was caused by:

1. **Automatic Periodic Check**: A timer running every 30 seconds that auto-checked server health
2. **Fake Health Check**: The health check method just waited 2 seconds and returned `true`
3. **Unwanted Auto-Navigation**: The page would automatically navigate back to splash after ~2 seconds

## Root Cause
- `Get.offAllNamed()` clears all routes and can destroy controllers/dependencies
- Dependencies registered with `lazyPut` may be garbage collected when not in use
- The splash controller tried to access `AuthRemoteDataSource` in its constructor, which fails if dependencies were cleared
- **Auto-navigation**: Server error page was automatically dismissing itself instead of waiting for user action

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced SplashBinding (`splash_binding.dart`)
- Added dependency check method `_ensureCoreServicesAreAvailable()`
- Automatically detects missing dependencies and re-initializes them
- Uses `InitialBinding.reinitializeDependencies()` to restore missing services
- Provides detailed logging for debugging

### 2. Improved InitialBinding (`initial_binding.dart`)
- Enhanced `reinitializeDependencies()` method with proper error handling
- Re-initializes dependencies in the correct order
- Checks if services already exist before creating new ones
- Provides comprehensive logging

### 3. Resilient Remote/Repository Bindings
- Added `fenix: true` to allow re-creation of lazy instances
- Added registration checks to prevent conflicts when called multiple times
- Enhanced logging for debugging dependency initialization

### 4. Safer SplashController (`splash_controller.dart`)
- Changed `AuthRemoteDataSource` from direct initialization to lazy getter
- Provides meaningful error message if dependency is still missing
- Prevents constructor crashes when dependencies are unavailable

### 5. Enhanced Critical Error Service (`critical_error_service.dart`)
- Added route tracking before showing server error page
- Enhanced logging for debugging navigation flow

### 6. **Fixed Server Error Controller (`server_error_controller.dart`) - NEW**
- **REMOVED** automatic periodic connectivity check that was auto-dismissing the error page
- **REPLACED** fake health check with real API call to `MetadataRepository.getPageContent()`
- **USER-CONTROLLED** retry - page only navigates back when user explicitly taps "Retry"
- Enhanced logging to show real health check results
- Proper error handling for when repositories are not available

## Flow After Fix

1. **Server Error Occurs**: 
   - `CriticalErrorService` detects 5xx error on critical endpoint
   - Shows server error page using `Get.offAllNamed('/server-error')`

2. **User Sees Error Page**:
   - Server error page stays visible until user takes action
   - **NO automatic dismissal** or background checks
   - User can read error details and decide when to retry

3. **User Clicks Retry**:
   - `ServerErrorController.retryConnection()` is called
   - **Real health check** is performed using `MetadataRepository`
   - If successful, navigates back to `/splash`
   - If failed, shows retry failed message and stays on error page

4. **Connection Restored & Navigation**:
   - `SplashBinding` is triggered
   - `SplashBinding._ensureCoreServicesAreAvailable()` checks for missing dependencies
   - If `AuthRemoteDataSource` is missing, calls `InitialBinding.reinitializeDependencies()`
   - All critical dependencies are restored

5. **Controller Creation**:
   - `SplashController` is created successfully
   - Lazy getter for `authRemoteDataSource` ensures safe access
   - App continues normal flow

## Key Improvements

### Navigation Control
- **User-Controlled Retry**: Server error page only dismisses when user explicitly retries
- **Real Health Check**: Actually tests the metadata endpoint instead of fake 2-second delay
- **No Auto-Dismissal**: Removed automatic periodic checks that were confusing users
- **Clear User Feedback**: Shows loading state during retry and clear success/failure messages

### Safety Features
- **Dependency Detection**: Automatic detection of missing dependencies
- **Graceful Recovery**: Re-initialization without app restart
- **Error Handling**: Meaningful error messages and fallback strategies
- **Conflict Prevention**: Registration checks prevent duplicate bindings

### Debugging Features
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for dependency lifecycle
- **Error Tracking**: Clear identification of missing dependencies
- **Flow Monitoring**: Track navigation and recovery process
- **Health Check Logging**: See exactly what the health check is doing

### Performance Features
- **Lazy Loading**: Dependencies only created when needed
- **Fenix Pattern**: Automatic recreation of disposed instances
- **Minimal Overhead**: Only re-initialize what's actually missing

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works:

1. **Trigger Server Error**: Make a request that returns HTTP 500
2. **Verify Error Page**: Server error page should appear and **STAY VISIBLE**
3. **Wait**: Page should **NOT auto-dismiss** - it should wait for user action
4. **Click Retry**: Tap the retry button to trigger real health check
5. **Check Recovery**: If server is back, app should navigate to splash without dependency errors
6. **Monitor Logs**: Check console for:
   - Real health check attempts
   - Dependency re-initialization messages
   - User-controlled navigation flow

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix
- ❌ Error page auto-dismissed after 2 seconds
- ❌ Users couldn't read error details
- ❌ No control over when to retry
- ❌ Confusing automatic behavior
- ❌ Dependency crashes on return

### After Fix  
- ✅ Error page stays until user decides to retry
- ✅ Users can read error details and understand the problem
- ✅ Clear retry button with loading state
- ✅ Real health check provides accurate server status
- ✅ Smooth dependency recovery without crashes
- ✅ User feels in control of the retry process

## Future Enhancements

1. **Route Restoration**: Store and restore the original route before error
2. **Dependency Health Check**: Periodic verification of critical dependencies
3. **Recovery Metrics**: Track successful recovery vs. failures  
4. **Offline Mode**: Graceful handling when device is offline
5. **Smart Retry**: Exponential backoff for repeated failures
6. **User Preference**: Allow users to enable/disable auto-retry if desired

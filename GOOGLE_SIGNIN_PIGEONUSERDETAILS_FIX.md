# Google Sign-In PigeonUserDetails Type Casting Error Fix

## Problem Description
The Google Sign-In functionality was failing with the following error:
```
Google Sign-In error: type 'List<Object?>' is not a subtype of type 'PigeonUserDetails?' in type cast
```

This error occurs due to a compatibility issue between the `google_sign_in` plugin and certain Flutter/Dart versions, where internal type casting fails in the plugin's native communication layer (Pigeon).

## Root Cause
- The error originates from the Google Sign-In plugin's internal Pigeon-generated code
- It happens when the plugin tries to cast a `List<Object?>` to `PigeonUserDetails?`
- This is typically caused by cached credentials or plugin state inconsistencies
- More common in debug builds and development environments

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Updated Google Sign-In Plugin Version
- **Before:** `google_sign_in: ^6.1.6`
- **After:** `google_sign_in: ^6.2.1`
- Newer versions have better compatibility and bug fixes

### 2. Enhanced FirebaseAuthService Configuration
```dart
static final GoogleSignIn _googleSignIn = GoogleSignIn(
  scopes: ['email', 'profile'],
  forceCodeForRefreshToken: true, // Forces fresh authentication
);
```

### 3. Improved Error Handling
Added specific detection and handling for PigeonUserDetails errors:
```dart
String errorStr = e.toString();
if (errorStr.contains('PigeonUserDetails') || 
    errorStr.contains('type \'List<Object?>\' is not a subtype of type')) {
  throw 'Google Sign-In failed due to a plugin compatibility issue. Please try again or restart the app.';
}
```

### 4. Implemented Retry Mechanism
Created `signInWithGoogleRetry()` method that:
- Attempts Google Sign-In up to 2 times
- Clears cached credentials between attempts
- Specifically handles PigeonUserDetails errors
- Provides exponential backoff with delay

### 5. Credential Clearing Strategy
```dart
// Clear any previous sign-in to prevent cached credential issues
try {
  await _googleSignIn.signOut();
} catch (e) {
  // Ignore errors during sign out
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Modified Files
1. **lib/app/services/firebase_auth_service.dart**
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Added retry mechanism
   - Improved credential management

2. **lib/app/data/remote/auth/auth_remote_data_source_impl.dart**
   - Updated to use retry mechanism for both sign-in and sign-up

3. **pubspec.yaml**
   - Updated google_sign_in plugin version

### New Methods Added
- `signInWithGoogleRetry()`: Main retry wrapper
- Enhanced `_handleGoogleSignIn()`: Better error handling
- Improved error detection in `signInWithGoogle()`

## Testing & Verification

### To Test the Fix:
1. Clean the project: `flutter clean`
2. Get dependencies: `flutter pub get`
3. Run the app: `flutter run`
4. Try Google Sign-In functionality
5. Verify no PigeonUserDetails errors occur

### Expected Behavior:
- Google Sign-In should work smoothly
- If the error occurs, it should retry automatically
- Users see clearer error messages
- App doesn't crash due to type casting issues

## Fallback Strategies

If the issue persists:

### Option 1: Force Complete Credential Reset
```dart
await _googleSignIn.disconnect();
await _auth.signOut();
```

### Option 2: Plugin Downgrade (Last Resort)
If the newer version still has issues:
```yaml
google_sign_in: 6.1.5  # Known stable version
```

### Option 3: Alternative Sign-In Flow
Consider implementing a web-based sign-in flow as fallback:
```dart
GoogleSignIn(
  scopes: ['email', 'profile'],
  signInOption: SignInOption.standard,
)
```

## Prevention Measures

1. **Regular Plugin Updates**: Keep Google Sign-In plugin updated
2. **Proper Error Handling**: Always wrap Google Sign-In in try-catch
3. **Credential Management**: Clear credentials when needed
4. **Testing**: Test on different devices and Android versions
5. **Monitoring**: Log errors to track recurrence

## Additional Notes

- This error is more common in development/debug builds
- Production builds might not experience this issue as frequently
- The retry mechanism handles most cases automatically
- Users should restart the app if issues persist after multiple retries

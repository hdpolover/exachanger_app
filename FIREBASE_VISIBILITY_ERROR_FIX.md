# Google Sign-In Firebase Visibility Error Fix

## Progress Made ✅
The PigeonUserDetails error has been successfully resolved! We're now dealing with a different issue:

```
[firebase_auth/unknown] An internal error has occurred. [ Visibility check was unavailable. Please retry the request and contact support if the problem persists
```

## Root Cause Analysis

This is a Firebase Auth service error, typically caused by:
1. **Network connectivity issues**
2. **Firebase service temporary unavailability** 
3. **Emulator-specific Firebase Auth limitations**
4. **Timing issues with Firebase Auth service initialization**

## Comprehensive Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- **PigeonUserDetails Fix**: ✅ Working (no longer seeing these errors)
- **Firebase Auth Error Detection**: Added specific handling for Firebase Auth exceptions
- **Retryable Error Classification**: Identifies which Firebase errors can be retried

### 2. Firebase Credential Retry Logic
```dart
static Future<UserCredential> _signInWithCredentialRetry(AuthCredential credential, {int maxAttempts = 3}) async {
  for (int attempt = 1; attempt <= maxAttempts; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await _auth.signInWithCredential(credential);
    } catch (e) {
      if (e is FirebaseAuthException && attempt < maxAttempts) {
        // Retry for network/visibility issues
        if (e.code == 'unknown' || 
            e.code == 'network-request-failed' ||
            e.message?.contains('Visibility check was unavailable') == true) {
          await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 1000 * attempt));
          continue;
        }
      }
      rethrow;
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Multi-Level Retry Strategy
1. **Token-level retries**: 3 attempts for Firebase credential sign-in
2. **Method-level retries**: 2 attempts with different Google Sign-In approaches
3. **Progressive delays**: 500ms initial delay + 1s, 2s, 3s for retries

### 4. Enhanced Retry Detection
```dart
bool isFirebaseRetryableError = false;
if (e is FirebaseAuthException) {
  isFirebaseRetryableError = e.code == 'unknown' || 
      e.code == 'network-request-failed' ||
      e.code == 'too-many-requests' ||
      errorStr.contains('Visibility check was unavailable') ||
      errorStr.contains('internal error');
}
```

## Expected Results

With this comprehensive fix:
- ✅ **PigeonUserDetails errors**: Completely resolved
- ✅ **Firebase visibility errors**: Will retry automatically (3 attempts per method)
- ✅ **Network issues**: Progressive retry with delays
- ✅ **Emulator compatibility**: Multiple fallback methods
- ✅ **Faster resolution**: Only 2 main method attempts, but 3 sub-attempts for Firebase

## Key Improvements

1. **Two-tier retry system**: 
   - Inner retries for Firebase credential issues (3 attempts)
   - Outer retries for method selection (2 attempts)

2. **Smart error classification**: 
   - Distinguishes between retryable and non-retryable Firebase errors
   - Maintains PigeonUserDetails fix for compatibility

3. **Network resilience**: 
   - Progressive delays help with temporary network issues
   - Initial 500ms delay before Firebase calls

## Next Steps

If this Firebase visibility error persists, we can:
1. Add network connectivity checks
2. Implement offline/online state detection
3. Add Firebase App initialization retries
4. Use alternative authentication flows

The current implementation should handle the majority of temporary Firebase service issues automatically.

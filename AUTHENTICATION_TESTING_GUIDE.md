## Authentication Persistence Testing Guide

### How to Test the Fix

#### 1. **Test Basic Sign-In Persistence**
1. Open the app
2. Complete sign-in process (email/password or Google)
3. Wait for the app to navigate to the main screen
4. Close the app completely (force quit)
5. Reopen the app
6. **Expected Result**: App should go directly to the main screen without asking for sign-in

#### 2. **Test Network Error Handling**
1. Sign in successfully
2. Turn off WiFi and mobile data
3. Close and reopen the app
4. **Expected Result**: App should still show main screen (not redirect to sign-in due to network issues)

#### 3. **Test Token Refresh**
1. Sign in successfully
2. Wait for token to near expiry (or manually modify token in storage)
3. Open the app and perform an action that requires API call
4. **Expected Result**: Token should refresh automatically without requiring re-sign-in

#### 4. **Test Manual Sign Out**
1. Sign in successfully
2. Navigate to Profile tab
3. Tap "Logout"
4. Close and reopen the app
5. **Expected Result**: App should show welcome/sign-in screen

#### 5. **Test Authentication State Consistency**
1. Sign in successfully
2. Check console logs for authentication state information
3. **Expected Result**: Logs should show consistent authentication state across all components

### What to Look For in Logs

The following logs indicate successful authentication persistence:

```
AuthService: Initializing authentication state
- Has access token: true
- Is signed in flag: true  
- Has user data: true
AuthService: User is authenticated: [UserName] ([UserEmail])

SplashController: Initializing...
SplashController: Auth state validation result: true
SplashController: User signed in status: true
SplashController: Token validation result: true
SplashController: Navigating to main screen
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: App redirects to sign-in after restart
**Cause**: Authentication state is not being saved properly
**Check**: Look for logs showing successful data persistence
**Solution**: Verify `saveUserDataFromSignin` is completing successfully

#### Issue: App shows welcome screen despite valid sign-in
**Cause**: Token validation failing or authentication state inconsistency  
**Check**: Look for token validation error logs
**Solution**: Check network connectivity and API endpoint availability

#### Issue: Firebase authentication mismatch
**Cause**: Firebase and local authentication states are out of sync
**Check**: Look for Firebase auth state change logs
**Solution**: AuthService now automatically syncs Firebase and local states

### Debug Commands

To check authentication state manually, you can add temporary debugging:

```dart
// In main.dart or app startup
final preferenceManager = Get.find<PreferenceManagerImpl>();
final authService = Get.find<AuthService>();

print("=== AUTH DEBUG ===");
print("Access token exists: ${(await preferenceManager.getString('access_token')).isNotEmpty}");
print("Is signed in: ${await preferenceManager.getBool('is_signed_in')}");
print("User data exists: ${(await preferenceManager.getUserData()) != null}");
print("AuthService state: ${authService.isAuthenticated.value}");
print("==================");
```

### Success Criteria

✅ User remains signed in after app restart  
✅ Network errors don't cause unnecessary sign-outs  
✅ Token refresh works automatically  
✅ Manual sign-out works correctly  
✅ Authentication state is consistent across app components  
✅ Comprehensive logging helps with debugging  

If all these criteria are met, the authentication persistence fix is working correctly!

# Payment Proof Upload Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of payment proof upload functionality with camera/gallery selection, file upload, and WhatsApp integration for the Exachanger app.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Camera/Gallery Selection

  - Image compression (max 800x800, 80% quality)
  - Error handling for image selection

### 2. File Upload API Integration
- **Backend Integration**:
  - `lib/app/data/remote/transaction/transaction_remote_data_source.dart`
  - `lib/app/data/remote/transaction/transaction_remote_data_source_impl.dart`
- **Features**:
  - Multipart file upload to `/transaction/upload-payment-proof/{id}`
  - Proper error handling
  - Returns boolean success status

### 3. Controller Integration
- **Location**: `lib/app/modules/exchange/controllers/exchange_controller.dart`
- **Function**: `uploadPaymentProof()`
- **Features**:
  - Handles file upload logic
  - Shows loading states
  - User feedback via snackbars
  - Error handling with network detection

### 4. Enhanced UI/UX
- **Upload Section**:
  - Preview of selected image
  - Clear upload status indicators
  - Replace image functionality
  - Visual feedback for upload status

### 5. WhatsApp Integration
- **Function**: `_openWhatsApp()`
- **Features**:
  - Automatically formats transaction details
  - Opens WhatsApp with pre-filled message
  - Configurable admin phone number
  - Error handling for WhatsApp not installed

### 6. Complete Workflow
- **Function**: `_confirmPayment()`
- **Flow**:
  1. Validates payment proof is uploaded
  2. Shows loading dialog during upload
  3. Uploads file to server
  4. Shows success dialog with options
  5. Provides "Contact Admin" button for WhatsApp
  6. Navigates back to main screen

## Dependencies Added
- `url_launcher: ^6.1.7` - For WhatsApp integration
- `http: ^0.13.5` - For multipart file uploads
- `image_picker` - Already available for camera/gallery access

## Configuration Required

### Admin Phone Number
Update the phone number in `_openWhatsApp()` method:
```dart
final phoneNumber = '1234567890'; // Replace with actual admin number
```

### API Endpoint
The upload endpoint is configured in `app_endpoints.dart`:
```dart
static const String uploadPaymentProof = '/transaction/upload-payment-proof';
```

## Usage Flow

1. **User selects image**:
   - Taps "Upload Payment Proof" button
   - Chooses camera or gallery from bottom sheet
   - Image is compressed and displayed as preview

2. **User confirms payment**:
   - Taps "Confirm Payment" button
   - File is uploaded to server
   - Success dialog appears

3. **WhatsApp integration**:
   - User can tap "Contact Admin" button
   - WhatsApp opens with pre-filled transaction details
   - Admin can process the transaction

## Error Handling

- **Network errors**: Proper error messages with retry suggestions
- **File selection errors**: User-friendly error messages
- **Upload failures**: Clear error indication with retry options
- **WhatsApp not installed**: Fallback error message

## Security Considerations

- Image compression reduces file size
- Server-side validation should be implemented
- File type validation on the server
- Proper authentication for upload endpoint

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test camera functionality on physical devices
2. Test gallery selection with various image formats
3. Test network error scenarios
4. Test WhatsApp integration on devices with/without WhatsApp
5. Test upload with large images
6. Test UI responsiveness during upload

## Future Enhancements

1. **Progress indicators**: Show upload progress percentage
2. **Multiple images**: Allow multiple payment proof images
3. **Image editing**: Basic crop/rotate functionality
4. **Offline support**: Queue uploads when offline
5. **Push notifications**: Notify when transaction is processed
6. **Chat integration**: In-app chat with admin

## Files Modified

1. `pubspec.yaml` - Added dependencies
2. `lib/app/data/remote/transaction/transaction_remote_data_source.dart`
3. `lib/app/data/remote/transaction/transaction_remote_data_source_impl.dart`
4. `lib/app/modules/exchange/controllers/exchange_controller.dart`
5. `lib/app/modules/exchange/views/confirm_exchange_view.dart`

## API Integration Notes

The implementation expects the server to:
- Accept multipart/form-data requests
- Use field name "proof_file" or "proofFile" for the image
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Handle authentication/authorization

The upload method can be easily modified to match your specific API requirements.
